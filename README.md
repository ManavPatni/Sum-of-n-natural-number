# Python Program to Find the Sum of Natural Numbers
In this program, you'll learn to find the sum of n natural numbers using while loop and display it.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics:

         * Python if...else Statement.
         * Python while Loop.
         
In the program below, we've used an if...else statement in combination with a while loop to calculate the sum of natural numbers up to num.
